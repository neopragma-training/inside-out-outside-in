<li>Audience: Programmers</li>
<li>Level: Intermediate to Advanced</li>

<li>Format: Demonstration, hands-on, some lecture</li>
<li>Methods: Experiential, practicum, group exploration</li>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
&quot;Outside-In&quot; is a general term that describes any approach to software development in which we specify a significant portion of the technical design in advance, before beginning to write code in earnest. &quot;Inside-Out&quot; describes any approach in which we build the solution incrementally and allow the technical design to emerge as necessary to support the evolving code. The purpose of the workshop is to explore the benefits and pitfalls of these approaches and to see how the strengths of each balances the weaknesses of the other.
</p>
<h2>Agenda and Timings</h2>
<p>
<dl>10 min. 
<dd>Rehearsed demonstration by a pair of developers with no explanation beforehand. Very strict inside-out development using the most rigorous and literal interpretation of test-driven development. The demonstration is designed to show how a practical design emerges bit by bit when we use automated unit tests to force the creation of every line of production code. By taking the technique to an extreme, the demonstration also highlights the pitfalls the approach.
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
<dl>5 min.
<dd>
Debrief of the demonstration. Facilitators guide group discussion to result in a list of the benefits and pitfalls of the inside-out approach.
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
<dl>15 min.
<dd>Hands-on coding exercise by participants working in pairs. The requirement is that they follow the same very strict TDD process as the facilitators demonstrated. Facilitators check on each pair and help them stick to the approach. 
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
<dl>5 min.
<dd>Debrief and summary of inside-out approach.
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
<dl>10 min. 
<dd>Rehearsed demonstration by a pair of developers with no explanation beforehand. The same solution as in the first demonstration is developed using an outside-in approach. The demonstration is designed to show how the approach provides a clear picture of the overall shape of the solution and speeds development by making domain entities and their relationships explicit at the start. By taking the technique to an extreme, the demonstration also highlights the pitfalls the approach.

<p>
<dl>5 min.
<dd>Debrief and summary of outside-in approach. Discussion of how the strengths identified for each approach mitigate the weaknesses of the other. 
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
<dl>15 min.
<dd>Hands-on coding exercise by participants working in pairs. They take a hybrid approach to solve a different programming problem. 
</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
<dl>10 min.
<dd>Debrief. Facilitated discussion of how the hybrid approach was different from either of the original approaches and how this information can be used on the job with real code.
