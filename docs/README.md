# Inside-Out and Outside-In Software Design

* Audience: Programmers
* Level: Intermediate to Advanced
* Duration: 60 min.
* Format: Demonstration, hands-on, some lecture
* Methods: Experiential, practicum, group exploration

## Learning Objectives

* Understand concepts, potential benefits, and potential pitfalls of each approach
* Understand how the benefits of each approach mitigate or offset the potential pitfalls of the other
* Understand how to combine the two approaches to maximize the value obtained from each while minimizing the pitfalls
* Gain gut-level insight into the techniques used with each approach through guided hands-on practice

## Abstract

"Outside-In" is a general term that describes any approach to software development in which we specify a significant portion of the technical design in advance, before beginning to write code in earnest. "Inside-Out" describes any approach in which we build the solution incrementally and allow the technical design to emerge as necessary to support the evolving code. The purpose of the workshop is to explore the benefits and pitfalls of these approaches and to see how the strengths of each balance the weaknesses of the other.
